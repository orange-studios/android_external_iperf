== iperf 3.?.? ????-??-?? ==
  * Setting CPU affinity now works on FreeBSD.
  * Added -I flag for server to write a PID file, mostly useful for
    daemon mode.
  * Bug fixes.

== iperf 3.0.1 2014-01-10 ==
  * Added the following new flags
     -D, --daemon	       run server as a daemon
     -L, --flowlabel           set IPv6 flow label (Linux only)
     -C, --linux-congestion    set congestion control algorithm (Linux only)
     -k, --blockcount #[KMG]   number of blocks (packets) to transmit
     	 	      	       (instead of -t or -n)
  * Bug fixes

  * Added the following new flags
     -F, --file name           xmit/recv the specified file

     -J, --json                output in JSON format
     -Z, --zerocopy            use a 'zero copy' method of sending data
     -O, --omit N              omit the first n seconds
     -T, --title str           prefix every output line with this string
  * more useful information in 'verbose' mode
  * Many bug fixes


== iperf 3.0b4 2010-08-02 ==

  * Added support for binding to a specific interface (-B)
  * Added support for IPv6 mode (-6)
  * Setting TCP window size (-w) is now supported
  * Updates to iperf_error
      * Added new errors
      * Should generate more relavent messages
  * Stream list now managed by queue.h macros
  * Test structures are now kept intact after a test is run (for API users)
  * Improved interval timer granularity
      * Support for decimal values
  * Many bug fixes

== iperf 3.0b3 2010-07-23 ==

  * Better error handling
      * All errors now handled with iperf_error()
      * All functions that can return errors return NULL or -1 on error and set i_errno appropriately
  * Iperf API intruduced
      * Support for adding new protocols
      * Added support for callback functions
          * on_connect - executes after a connection is made to the server
          * on_new_stream - executes after a new stream is created
          * on_test_start - executes right before the test begins
          * on_test_finish - executes after the test is finished
  * Added early support for verbose mode (-V)

== iperf 3.0b2 2010-07-15 ==

  * UDP mode now supported
      * Support for setting bandwidth (-b)
      * Parallel UDP stream support
      * Reverse mode UDP support
  * Support for setting TCP_NODELAY (-N), disabling Nagle's Algorithm
  * Support for setting TCP MSS (-M)
      * Note: This feature is still in development. It is still very buggy.

== iperf 3.0b1 2010-07-08 ==

  * TCP control socket now manages messages between client and server
  * Dynamic server (gets test parameters from client)
      * Server can now set test options dynamically without having to restart.
          * Currently supported options: -l, -t, -n, -P, -R
          * Future options: -u, -b, -w, -M, -N, -I, -T, -Z, -6
  * Results exchange
      * Client can now see server results (and vice versa)
  * Reverse mode (-R)
      * Server sends, client receives
